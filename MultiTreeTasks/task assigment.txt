 1.You are given a tree of N nodes represented as a set of N-1 pairs of nodes (parent node, child node), each in the range (0..N-1). Example:
7
2 4
3 2
5 0
3 5
5 6
5 1

Write a program to read the tree and find:
a)the root node
b)all leaf nodes
c)all middle nodes
d)the longest path in the tree
e)* all paths in the tree with given sum S of their nodes
f)* all subtrees with given sum S of their nodes
